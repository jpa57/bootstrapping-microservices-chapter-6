# Example-2

This example uses Terraform to create a private Elastic Container Registry (ECR) in AWS.
The code is forked from Ashley Davis's repo and modified to use AWS.   See the writeup
on getting AWS ready for Terraform at

URL http://t.ly/dVcp

Run this example using:

```bash
cd example-2/scripts
terraform init
terraform apply
```
