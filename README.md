# Chapter-6

Code and examples for Chapter 6 of [Bootstrapping Microservices](http://bit.ly/2o0aDsP), modified for AWS.

In chapter 6 we build a production environment for microservices on Kubernetes using Terraform.

Please see README in each sub-directory for instructions on starting the particular example.  
The README will indicate whether that section has been ported to AWS.
